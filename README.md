**1. Introduction:**
L-Mart Store aims to leverage data analytics to gain insights into its sales performance and optimize forecasting accuracy. Power BI, a robust business intelligence tool, was employed to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales trends.

**2. Dashboard Creation:**
Utilizing Power BI's intuitive interface, interactive dashboards were created to visualize sales data over time. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total orders and average day of ship were prominently displayed, allowing stakeholders to monitor performance at a glance.

**3. Data Analysis:**
In-depth data analysis was conducted to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in the sales data. Time series decomposition techniques were employed to separate the data into trend, seasonal, and residual components, enabling a deeper understanding of underlying patterns.

**4. Sales Forecasting:**
Advanced time series forecasting models, including ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Exponential Smoothing, were utilized to forecast future sales trends. These models take into account historical sales patterns and seasonality to generate accurate forecasts for upcoming periods.

**5. Actionable Insights:**
Based on the analysis and forecasting results, several actionable insights were derived:
- Seasonal Trends: Identify peak seasons and adjust inventory and marketing strategies accordingly.
- Product Performance: Identify top-performing products and allocate resources to promote and stock these items.
